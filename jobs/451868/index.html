Tired of not getting paid what you are worth when the company is making a profit? Are you tired of missing out on your family life? We are looking for motivated individuals that want more out of life than the 9-5 \"JOB\" and are ready to wager on themselves in a business.\n\nAre you ready for a change?\n\nI came into this business with some sales experience but with zero insurance experience. My husband and I both came from the veterinary industry. We plugged into the system and our mentors and built our business to what it is today. Now we want to help others do the same. We are a family atmosphere that puts your needs first. We work for you, not the other way around. We help you get what you want in this industry, and we get to help families protect their legacy while doing so.\n\nIt probably sounds way too good to be true, because it did to us too!\n\nTo be honest, we both had our doubts when we first came... in. That all changed when we started meeting people just like us, wanting to make an impact in the world. Surrounding myself with others with a similar mindset who encourage one another and who want to see others succeed was very refreshing. We saw what hard work could create and build, and the best part was seeing that the hard work we put in was going to come back to us, not the company. We became our own company.\n\nThe Position:\n\nAs an agent you will help families plan for their future. If an unexpected tragedy strikes, is there a plan in place to continue mortgage payments? How about other bills?\n\nYou will obtain clients through a state-of-the-art lead generation system. Cold calls are a thing of the past. You don't have to call all your family and friends to get their business. We get you in front of families that want your help. You will follow up on the family's request for more information and meet your clients virtually. If you are not licensed, we will help you get licensed. If you are new to sales, we will teach you how to talk to people and provide them what they are looking for through the systems we have built in our Agency.\n\nYou will be matched up with one of our leaders to help guide you down the path to success. But you will be exposed to an entire agency full of sales professionals eager to help you grow!\n\n· Health Insurance Benefits Available\n\n· Meet With Clients over the internet utilizing ZOOM, Facetime, etc.: All leads are provided through state-of-the-art leads generating, no cold calling or prospecting\n\n· One of America's Fastest Growing Companies: Inc 5000 #1022 for last 6 years, with multiple Stevie awards, and Best in Biz awards\n\n· Luxury All Expense Paid Vacations: Free, world-class travel to reward you for your production\n\n· Passive Income: Eventually you'll have the ability to replace your personal production\n\n· Untapped Market Potential: Demand nationwide has not been sufficiently met by our products\n\n· Team Culture that seeks to promote without over-working you: At our core we believe in balance\n\nDiscovering a mutual fit in our hiring process is very important to us, as we don't align with everyone, and we recognize you feel the same way.
