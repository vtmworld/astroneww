We seek creative and tenacious individuals to help us deliver on our proven system of driving success through service.\n\nService is at the heart of what we do. At Learning Network, you will be among real people who care, about their customers and their colleagues. In our system, we prioritize service by making sure the details are done and done well - every time. We make promises and we keep those promises. We recognize that our students and families dont have to choose us. Thus, service is the bedrock of everything we do. Its embedded deep within our culture. White-glove service with a smile is an expectation of every employee.\n\nAt Learning Network, youll be a part of a system that works. Youll learn and then implement that system making you and us special in the eyes of our students and families. Youll sleep better knowing you make a difference in the lives of thousands of people. Youll bring access to our innovative educational model to thousands of students. Youll do this amongst a supportive community of people who care. In return, youll care. Youll show you care by learning our system, being teachable, and using that system to drive positive academic results. Youll do this not only by doing your job well but by valuing relationships - with customers and with colleagues. Youll achieve your goals by helping others achieve theirs.\n\nWorking at Learning Network isnt for everyone. But for those that commit to working hard and who prioritize service, students, and colleagues, its an incredibly rewarding experience.\n\nPosition Summary\n\nWe have an immediate opening for an Online Special Education Teacher (Remote; Virtual). In this role, you will deliver personalized and engaging instruction and support to special education students.\n\nWe are specifically looking for a Special Education Teacher who is open to both instruction and case management.\n\nThe vast majority of your time will be spent contacting students and parents directly to provide one on one support. Youll make these connections every day using chat, email, text messages, and telephone calls. If you dont like the idea of proactively reaching out to students and families every day, this isnt the right position.\n\nAbout a quarter of your time will be spent providing personalized feedback to students via grading assignments and recording personalized video feedback. A small portion of your time might be spent supplementing our system curriculum by developing and/or delivering quality live and recorded lessons as determined in collaboration with your supervisor.\n\nYoull leverage your knowledge of your subject matter, your skills as an educator, and your mastery of Google Apps for Education, learning management systems, and modern communication tools to drive personalized learning experiences that yield strong academic results. Your innovation will maximize student engagement and knowledge acquisition yet youll frequently forgo technology to provide instruction and support to students and parents using telephone calls from someone that cares.\n\nThis position is a 12-month, year-round position with paid time off and paid sick leave available. We offer a slate of more than ten paid company holidays plus an additional period of time off to rest and reflect over the winter holidays.\n\nThough we operate in the online education space, school community is important to us. Face-to-face activities like student testing require in-person support. Occasional travel to support proctoring of student tests and other face-to-face events like graduation is required.\n\nThis is a full-time position designated as exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Performing these job duties along with those of another full-time job is not feasible.\n\nJob Duties\n Serve all stakeholders with integrity, humility, and joy while consistently modeling the importance of both task competency and relationships;\n Participate in Company events, activities, and meetings with a smile and an infectious, great attitude;\n Effectively support special education students by implementing lesson plans, delivering engaging and insightful lessons, and ensuring student learning of established curriculum using company tools;\n Evaluate student needs and prior written history to determine and help implement appropriate accommodations;\n Ensure individualized education plans are properly documented and implemented;\n Demonstrate ownership and alignment with company quality standards when working with students, parents, colleagues, or others;\n Maintain a courteous and positive demeanor in every interaction when responding to a wide range of inquiries from students, guardians, and colleagues;\n Provide ongoing monitoring of student progress intervening as needed to address gaps and deliver remediation;\n Collaborate with peers and administrators in a professional, positive, and student-focused manner;\n Provide essential proctoring services during periods of student testing including traveling to testing locations, setting up student testing materials, completing assessment training, and facilitating the test;\n Maintain a strong and supportive company culture by supporting company recruitment, retention, and community outreach goals; and\n All other duties as assigned.\n\nEssential Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities\n\nCandidates must live in the state of Oklahoma in order to be considered for this position.\n Strong interpersonal skills with the demonstrated ability to consistently lead and serve others with humility, kindness, empathy, and joy;\n Essential abilities for this job include but are not limited to: instruction, communication, technical, critical thinking, customer orientation, teamwork, organization, and attention to detail;\n Demonstrated ability to establish rapport, gain commitment, and convey challenging concepts to learners using a broad spectrum of technological tools and tactics;\n Verifiably skilled in engaging unresponsive, struggling students;\n Demonstrated ability to take initiative, work independently, collaborate with others, and effectively build relationships with students, families, and colleagues;\n Able to quickly learn, use, and adapt new technology and systems;\n Able to travel to physically proctor student assessments; and\n Demonstrated professional oral and written communication skills.\n\nEducational Qualifications\n Bachelors or Master's degree in Special Education required\n Current Special Education Teaching License; and\n Teacher certification\n\nExperiential Qualifications\n At least three (3) years of experience teaching special education is required.\n Extensive experience writing and implementing IEPS and holding IEP meetings.\n At least two (2) years of online teaching experience is preferred;\n At least one (1) year of experience learning or working online is preferred;\n Able to adequately meet legal requirements for performing this position;\n Ability to obtain teaching certification in Arizona, Colorado and Washington.\n Ability to pass required background checks; and\n Ability and willingness to travel to assigned testing locations and physically proctor student assessments.
