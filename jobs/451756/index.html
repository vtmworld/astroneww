In December 2016, I came across a job post on Naukri from Jacob Goodman, one of the co-owners of Fresh Prints. They were looking for someone to lead their Operations team in India. The post had already been taken down, but I decided to send Jacob an email anyway. To my surprise, he replied, and soon I found myself stepping into what would be a life-changing opportunity.\n\nDuring the interview process, it became clear just how new everything was. There was no office, no payroll system, no established infrastructure at all. But what struck me was Jacob and Joshs unwavering belief in the vision they had for Fresh Prints.\n\nThey didnt have all the answers, but their passion was contagious, and I knew I wanted to be part of building something from the ground up. So, I jumped in. I found an office, figured out payroll, and brought in my childhood best friend... to help get things off the ground. There were so many unknowns in those early days, but thats exactly what made it so exciting.\n\nI had the chance to wear multiple hats, solve problems on the fly, and help build something tangible. What started as a team of two quickly grew, and over the next few years, we scaled operations across Finance, Tech, and Marketing.\n\nAs the first employee of Fresh Prints India, Ive been lucky enough to help shape this company from its earliest stages. After a short break to have my daughter, I returned to lead HR and recruiting. Weve gone from a scrappy startup to a team of 400+ people across three countries. But the truth is, even with all that growth, we know its still day 1.\n\nOne of the things Im most proud of is how we made it through COVID-19 together. I still remember March 15, 2020Josh, our co-owner and CEO, sent an email to everyone announcing that the office was shutting down indefinitely. Just like so many people around the world, we were suddenly isolated from the routines and connections we relied on. We were nervous and found ourselves staring down a financial cliff.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, we went from million-dollar months to zero revenue. All universities closed. All events stopped.\n\nBut wed been planning for the worst for years. From day 1 we knew wed have to make our balance sheet a strength. We figured negative events were inevitable and our stress test was to always make sure we could operate for at least year of 0 revenue without making layoffs. When Covid hit, we were scared, but felt prepared.\n\nAnd as we struggled to adapt, something unexpected happenedwe pivoted. As PPE demand soared, we initially hesitated, but then realized this was exactly what the world needed. Shifting from tees to PPE wasnt just a business decision; it was about showing up in a way that mattered. The entire team rallied behind the idea, and our adaptability and speed helped us keep going.\n\nWhile so many companies were just trying to survive, Fresh Prints not only made it but even grew. It wasnt easy, but this experience showed me how deeply committed we are to each other and our mission. The grit and determination we built in those tough times, that willingness to adapt and keep each other steadyit's what defines us today.\n\nThe opportunities that were available to me when I joined as the first employee are still here today! In fact, theyre bigger now than ever. Were at an exciting point in our journey, and were looking for people who want to have a massive impact on the next chapter of this story.\n\nIf youre someone who sees opportunity and isnt afraid to chase it, this is the role for you. Were looking for someone to take ownership, challenge the norm, and help us build something that lasts. Fresh Prints is a place where there are no limits. If youre someone who likes running at challenges head on, this is the role for you. If youre looking for a clear set of instructions, this role isnt.\n\nIf our story resonates, we want to hear from you!\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n\nAs a member of our Recruitment team, you're going to have a wide-ranging group of responsibilities and goals.
