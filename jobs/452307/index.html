If you are resourceful and learn quickly, we provide legal receptionist and intake training. No legal experience required! Our ideal candidate will thrive working from home, have a high attention to detail, and enjoy a fast-paced work environment. If this sounds like you keep on reading!\n\nWe are a boutique virtual receptionist service for law firms in the United States and Canada. Our clients rely on us to be the first impression and the voice of their law firm. Law firms invest a lot of money in Back Office Betties in order to provide their own callers with a world-class customer service experience, meaning that we must continually be the best at what we do. With that being said, the Legal Intake Specialist is the most important role in our company! Our Legal Intake Specialists go above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service through detailed call handling instructions, scheduling appointments, answering FAQ's, taking messages and transferring calls.\n\nWhat does a day in the life of a Legal Intake Specialist look like? We are glad you asked! A typical Legal Intake Specialist takes about 90-120 calls per day. This is a very fast paced environment! Calls are typically back-to-back throughout the day. You are answering for about 60+ different law firms on any given day. This means each call is unique. One second you might be answering for a criminal attorney that has a potential new client on the line. The next call might be opposing counsel on a case wishing to speak with the attorney. Being confident is key! You never know what call is coming next. While you are going through your day you are supported by an exceptional team of Betties via our team chat. If you have a mean GIF game, you will fit right in!\n\nCore Values:\n Do the right thing, even when it's hard: Never take a shortcut, because it's more convenient for you. Take the long road when it's best for the client, the team, or the company. Act with integrity, especially when no one is looking. Do whatever it takes to turnaround a bad situation.\n Figure it out and get it done: Ideas deserve praise, execution is worthy of worship. Exhaust all resources. Identify. Research.\n Be a goal digger: Achieve the extraordinary. Bring your A-game. Exceed expectations.\n Focus on the good of the whole: It's not about who is right; it's about what is right. Community (teamwork + clients) before self. Teamwork makes all of our dreams work.\n Own the outcome, no excuses: If you want something, be proactive and go after it. Ask \"How do I get there?\" instead of complaining about being there. Foster a culture of candor and accountability.\n ABC, Always Be Curious: Have a thirst for learning. Practice a growth mindset. Continuously explore new and better ways.\n\nRequirements\n You MUST apply through our Careers Website. Go here to apply:\n You MUST complete our Culture Index survey.
