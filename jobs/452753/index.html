Something that combines the beauty of the Churchs spirituality with world-class product and content execution.\n\nWe launched the app in December of 2018 and have been blown away with the incredible growth & traction. Hallow has been downloaded over 15 million times with over 250,000 5-star reviews. We're blessed to be backed by some of the best mission-driven investors in the world and are excited to build out the team to help a lot more folks grow closer to God.\n\nWe are a startup.
