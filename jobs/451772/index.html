this is a fast-paced environment\n Solution focused vs. excuse focused\n\nAbout Us:\n\nCrushing it on Camera is a fast-growing company, built by a team that is passionate about helping people gain confidence and ultimately sales - with online video.\n\nOur founders, Abby & David, are award winning writers, actors and producers who work alongside your favorite celebrities in Hollywood.\n\nThey realized Hollywood had a repeatable, predictable formula that would work like magic for the regular professionals as wellif they only had access to it.\n\nSo, they condensed it, reformatted it, proved it by doing it themselves first, built a brand that was a smashing success and have now enjoyed showing hundreds of others the steps to achieving the same business changing success (with countless case studies and testimonials to back it up!)\n\nTheir proven approach - the Hollywood method - takes all the secrets movie makers use to keep audiences engaged and spending\n\nand breaks them down into a step-by-step formula that allows our students to create compelling, professional looking videos in minutes instead of hours.\n\nThe result is a clear, repeatable blueprint students can use to stand out in any market -
