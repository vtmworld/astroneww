Maybe you're a Windows-first tech who wants to maintain your skills in Microsoft 365, but also dip your toe in Google Workspace, and get really good at Apple device management.
And maybe you're sick of corporate drama, and have no desire to "return to the... office."

some experience in supporting desktop applications (Office, Creative Cloud, etc.)
some experience managing Windows devices in Microsoft 365 (Intune, Entra)
experience troubleshooting computer hardware/software and basic networks
